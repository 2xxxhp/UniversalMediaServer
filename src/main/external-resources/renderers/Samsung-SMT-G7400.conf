# RENDERER INFORMATION
#

# RendererName: Determines the name that is displayed in the UMS user
# interface when this renderer connects.
RendererName = Samsung SMT-G7400

# RendererIcon: Determines the icon that is displayed in the UMS user
# interface when this renderer connects. By default, these icons are
# bundled with UMS in ums.jar, but they can easily be customised:

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RENDERER RECOGNITION
#
# When a renderer connects, it sends a "User-Agent" header. UMS tries to
# match that header with all configuration profiles. If none of the profiles
# matches, the message "Unknown User-Agent:" will be displayed in the logs and
# UMS will switch to a default profile.
#
# Because matching involves all renderer configuration profiles, it is
# important to match as long a string as possible. This increases the chances
# that a match is unique. Version numbers are best avoided.
#
# To learn the exact headers of any renderer, set the logging level in
# "logback.xml" to "TRACE" and look for messages like "Received on socket:".
#
# ============================================================================
# The following identifying headers were detected:
#
# User-Agent: Linux/2.6.35 UPnP/1.0 NDS_MHF DLNADOC/1.50
# ============================================================================
#

# UserAgentSearch: Optional regular expression to detect a connected renderer.
# The expression is case insensitive. When the expression is empty User-Agent
# headers are not used, this is the default. Note that one renderer can use
# several different User-Agent headers.
#
# Examples:
#
# UserAgentSearch = Platinum/.*DLNADOC/|yxplayer2|MPlayer |NSPlayer/
# UserAgentSearch = Windows-Media-Player-DMS|Microsoft-Windows
#
# Ignoring the "UPnP/1.0" and "UPnP/1.0 DLNADOC/1.50" headers since they are
# too general, plus they can be detected from the additional header.
UserAgentSearch = NDS_MHF

# UserAgentAdditionalHeader: Optional additional HTTP header for better
# detection. When defined, UMS also considers this header when trying to find
# a match. Even when the standard UserAgentSearch match fails, this extra
# header can provide a positive match.
#UserAgentAdditionalHeader = 

# UserAgentAdditionalHeaderSearch: Regular expression to search for in the
# additional HTTP header.
#UserAgentAdditionalHeaderSearch = 

SeekByTime = true
CreateDLNATreeFaster = true

# TRANSCODING AND MUXING CAPABILITIES
#
# It is very likely that a renderer cannot render all file formats. If this is
# the case, UMS should transcode or mux the file to a format that the renderer
# can display. This section defines the format that UMS should transcode or
# mux to.
#

# TranscodeVideo: Profile to use for video transcoding.
# One of the following:
#
#     MPEGPS-MPEG2-AC3: MPEG-2 video, AC-3 audio, MPEG-PS container
#     MPEGTS-MPEG2-AC3: MPEG-2 video, AC-3 audio, MPEG-TS container
#     WMV:       WMV2 video, WMA2 audio, ASF container
#
# XXX MPEGPS-MPEG2-AC3 was previously named MPEGAC3. The old name is deprecated.
# XXX Currently only the MEncoder engine supports all 3 profiles.
# Other engines transcode video to the MPEGPS-MPEG2-AC3 profile,
# regardless of this setting.
#
# The default value is MPEGPS-MPEG2-AC3.
TranscodeVideo = MPEGPS-MPEG2-AC3

# TranscodeAudio: Profile to use for audio transcoding.
# Currently supported: "LPCM", "MP3" or "WAV".
# Default: LPCM
TranscodeAudio = LPCM

# DefaultVBVBufSize: Whether or not to use the default DVD buffer size. Setting
# this to "false" means a greater bit rate and faster encoding, but it can
# generate incompatible videos dependent on the renderer.
DefaultVBVBufSize = false

# MuxH264ToMpegTS: Set to "true" if the media renderer supports H264 and MPEG2
# in a MPEGTS file. Ignored if MediaInfo = true.
MuxH264ToMpegTS = true

# MuxDTSToMpeg: Set to "true" if the media renderer supports DTS in a MPEG
# file. Ignored if MediaInfo = true.
MuxDTSToMpeg = false

# WrapDTSIntoPCM: Set to "true" if the media renderer supports DTS wrapped
# into LPCM in a MPEG file.
WrapDTSIntoPCM = true

# MuxLPCMToMpeg: Set to "true" if the media renderer supports LPCM in a MPEG
# file. Ignored if MediaInfo = true.
MuxLPCMToMpeg = true

# MaxVideoBitrateMbps: The maximum bitrate supported by the media renderer.
# Setting to "0" means unlimited.
# If the CPU is not very fast, it may be better to avoid using bandwidth limit
# and instead lower the bitrate by defining "CustomMencoderQualitySettings"
# and/or "CustomFFmpegOptions" since they can be less CPU-intensive.
MaxVideoBitrateMbps = 0

# MaxVideoWidth and MaxVideoHeight: Maximum width and height supported by the
# media renderer.
# Setting to "0" means unlimited.
# Both must be 0, or both must be higher than 0.
MaxVideoWidth = 1920
MaxVideoHeight = 1080

# H264Level41Limited: Set to "true" if the media renderer supports only H264
# L4.1 at most.
H264Level41Limited = true

# TranscodeAudioTo441kHz: Set to "true" if music files need to be resampled at
# 44.1kHz.
TranscodeAudioTo441kHz = false

# TranscodeFastStart: Set to "true" if the renderer has a short timeout delay
# and needs to receive transcoded video with minimal delay. If set to "false",
# UMS will take some time to buffer some of the transcoded video.
TranscodeFastStart = true

# TranscodedVideoFileSize: The amount of transcoded data is unknown at the
# time of transcoding. Still, some renderers expect a size for the video file
# to be returned. Possible values are:
#            0: No size is sent to the renderer (default value)
# 100000000000: Fake size of 100 GB is sent to the renderer.
#           -1: Specific value that works perfect for the PS3. It is against
#               the DLNA spec though.
TranscodedVideoFileSize = -1

# StreamExtensions: Comma separated list of file extensions that are forced
# to be streamed and never transcoded. Best left empty if MediaInfo = true,
# and define "Supported" formats instead.
StreamExtensions = m4v

# ForceJPGThumbnails: Some renderers require thumbnails to be represented as
# JPEGs (JPEG_TN) in the DLNA directory XML (e.g. Sony Bravia TVs and Blu-ray Disc
# players). Set this to true to force UMS to use this representation. Note:
# this has no effect on thumbnail file formats or content-type headers.
ForceJPGThumbnails = true

# ChunkedTransfer: Some renderers are particular about the "Content-Length"
# headers in requests (e.g. Sony Blu-ray Disc players). By default, UMS will send
# a "Content-Length" that refers to the total media size, even if the exact
# length is unknown. Default value is false. Set this option to true to omit
# sending a length when it is unknown.
ChunkedTransfer = false

# SubtitleHttpHeader: Some devices recognize a custom HTTP header for
# retrieving the contents of a subtitles file. Set this option to the name of
# that custom header and UMS will send the URL for the subtitles file in that
# header (e.g. Samsung devices recognize the "CaptionInfo.sec" header).
# Default value is "", which means UMS will not send such header information.
SubtitleHttpHeader = CaptionInfo.sec

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMAGES
#

# AutoExifRotate: Many cameras store information in the image file about the
# orientation of the camera while the picture was taken, allowing viewers to
# know which way was up. Set this option to "true" to allow UMS to rotate JPEG
# files based on EXIF information contained in the file, and relieve the
# renderer of that task.
