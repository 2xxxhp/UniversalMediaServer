# RENDERER INFORMATION

# RendererName: Determines the name that is displayed in the UMS user
# interface when this renderer connects.
RendererName = Samsung SMT-G7400

# RendererIcon: Determines the icon that is displayed in the UMS user
# interface when this renderer connects. By default, these icons are
# bundled with UMS in ums.jar, but they can easily be customised:

# RENDERER RECOGNITION
#
# When a renderer connects, it sends a "User-Agent" header. UMS tries to
# match that header with all configuration profiles. If none of the profiles
# matches, the message "Unknown User-Agent:" will be displayed in the logs and
# UMS will switch to a default profile.
#
# Because matching involves all renderer configuration profiles, it is
# important to match as long a string as possible. This increases the chances
# that a match is unique. Version numbers are best avoided.
#
# To learn the exact headers of any renderer, set the logging level in
# "logback.xml" to "TRACE" and look for messages like "Received on socket:".
#
# ============================================================================
# The following identifying headers were detected:
#
# User-Agent: Linux/2.6.35 UPnP/1.0 NDS_MHF DLNADOC/1.50
# ============================================================================
#

# UserAgentSearch: Optional regular expression to detect a connected renderer.
# The expression is case insensitive. When the expression is empty User-Agent
# headers are not used, this is the default. Note that one renderer can use
# several different User-Agent headers.
#
# Examples:
#
# UserAgentSearch = Platinum/.*DLNADOC/|yxplayer2|MPlayer |NSPlayer/
# UserAgentSearch = Windows-Media-Player-DMS|Microsoft-Windows
#
# Ignoring the "UPnP/1.0" and "UPnP/1.0 DLNADOC/1.50" headers since they are
# too general, plus they can be detected from the additional header.
UserAgentSearch = NDS_MHF

# UserAgentAdditionalHeader: Optional additional HTTP header for better
# detection. When defined, UMS also considers this header when trying to find
# a match. Even when the standard UserAgentSearch match fails, this extra
# header can provide a positive match.
#UserAgentAdditionalHeader = 

# UserAgentAdditionalHeaderSearch: Regular expression to search for in the
# additional HTTP header.
#UserAgentAdditionalHeaderSearch =

# SubtitleHttpHeader: Some devices recognize a custom HTTP header for
# retrieving the contents of a subtitles file. Set this option to the name of

# header (e.g. Samsung devices recognize the "CaptionInfo.sec" header).
# Default value is "", which means UMS will not send such header information.

# IMAGES
#

# AutoExifRotate: Many cameras store information in the image file about the
# orientation of the camera while the picture was taken, allowing viewers to
# know which way was up. Set this option to "true" to allow UMS to rotate JPEG
# files based on EXIF information contained in the file, and relieve the
# renderer of that task.
