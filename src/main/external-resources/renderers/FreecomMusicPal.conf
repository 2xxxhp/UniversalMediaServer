# Size of the transcoded file (unknown length) sent to the renderer (could determine browsing failure/success)
# Possible values: 
#           -1: Specific value working with the PS3, means perfect transcoding and copying support (it's against the dlna spec though)
#            0: size attribute is NOT sent to the renderer (defaut value if this parameter isn't used)
# 100000000000: 100Gb, if you want to be sure that the media file is not cutted before the end ?
